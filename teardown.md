# Project Teardown & Cost Control

To ensure zero ongoing cost, the following actions were taken after validation:

1. Virtual machine was stopped after testing
2. Monitoring data was reviewed and screenshots captured
3. Resource group can be fully deleted to remove all associated resources

This teardown strategy ensures cost awareness and responsible cloud usage.
